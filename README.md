# VAE
1. Data Preparation
a. Preprocessing Function
The images are read, resized to 64x64 pixels, and normalized so that pixel values are in the range [0, 1].
This ensures that the data is consistent and suitable for training.
b. Loading the Dataset
The code collects all image paths from the specified directory, applies the preprocessing function, shuffles the data, batches it (64 images per batch), and prefetches it to improve training efficiency.
c. Visualizing the Dataset
The visualize_batch function displays a grid of images from a batch, helping to confirm that the data is correctly loaded.
2. VAE Components
A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is composed of three main parts: the Encoder, the Sampling Layer, and the Decoder.

a. Encoder
Purpose: Encodes input images into a compact latent space representation.
Architecture:
Two convolutional layers for feature extraction.
A fully connected layer (dense layer) processes flattened features.
Two outputs:
mu: the mean of the latent space distribution.
log_var: the log variance of the latent space distribution.
Why Variational? Instead of encoding data into fixed points, the VAE represents them as a probability distribution.
b. Sampling Layer
Purpose: Samples a latent vector z from the distribution defined by mu and log_var.
Implementation:
Random noise epsilon is drawn from a normal distribution.
The formula for sampling is:
z = mu + exp(0.5 * log_var) * epsilon
This ensures that the sampling process is differentiable, which is necessary for backpropagation.
c. Decoder
Purpose: Reconstructs the original image from the latent vector z.
Architecture:
Fully connected layers transform z into a tensor.
Transposed convolutional layers (upsampling) reconstruct the image.
The final layer uses a sigmoid activation to ensure pixel values are between 0 and 1.
3. VAE Model
The VAE class integrates the Encoder, Sampling Layer, and Decoder:

Input: An image.
Output: A reconstructed image, along with mu and log_var.
4. Training Process
a. Loss Function
Reconstruction Loss: Measures the difference between the original and reconstructed images using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
KL Divergence Loss: Ensures the learned latent space distribution is close to a standard normal distribution.
The combined loss is:
Loss = Reconstruction Loss + KL Divergence Loss
b. Training Loop
For each epoch:
The model processes batches of images.
Computes the loss.
Updates the model weights using the Adam optimizer.
5. Key Parameters
Latent Dimension: 512 (size of the latent space).
Batch Size: 64 (number of images processed together).
Epochs: 50 (number of complete passes through the dataset).
Learning Rate: 0.001 (step size for updating weights).
Output
After training, the VAE can:

Generate new images by sampling latent vectors z from the latent space.
Reconstruct existing images from their latent representations.
